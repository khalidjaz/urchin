TODO:

- Install activerecord-import plugin (performance improvement while importing recipients)
- use Resque instead of DelayedJob because:
    We need multiple queues
    We don't care / dislike numeric priorities
    We don't need to persist every Ruby object ever
    We have potentially huge queues
    We want to see what's going on
    We expect a lot of failure / chaos
    We can setup Redis
    We're not running short on RAM
