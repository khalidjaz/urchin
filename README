1- In the new version of my program I used the old hash tag style instead of the new one in order to be compatible with the Ruby 1.8.7.

2- I used shorter methods as they are easier to read, maintain and test.

3- I changed the logic of the billing system solving the problem of the package's change (in the old version changing the package effected the old users)

4- I wrote tests (better late than never).

5- I upgraded the application from Rails 3.0.3 to 3.1


Things to do:
-Use Cronjob to set units in users accounts.
-Improve README.
-Write comments in Rdoc style.
-Use Devise instead of Authlogic, because Devise has bigger community and they improve it more often.
